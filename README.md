GistRoulette
============

Fetches and displays a random gist using Github's API.

(Really just a quick one-off webapp to play with Backbone, Marionette, RequireJS, and Sinatra.)


Demo
----

http://gistroulette.herokuapp.com


Installation
------------

It's a Sinatra app. You know what to do.


Configuration
-------------

Edit config.yml to use your username and password (to avoid bombarding the API with a billion anonymous requests).
